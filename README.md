# Web-monitoring
Final project for SDA

We are trying to create a web monitoring website by using Python and Django.
We will have a background service to check the up time. It will contain a simple 
FE(Frontend) for users to login and setup a monitor for their webpage
and a BE(Backend) to store that data in the Database. A service that will 
run at check if the websites are up and report back to the necessary users.

By 20th of this November we should go through HTML/CSS/BOOTSTRAP and for the backend python/django as a rewine. 
ANd from the next wee we will start our frontend pat and it we should have a basic frontend layout by thw end of 27th of November and the will start the backend part. 
By 4th December we should ecreate a structure for back end part. 
After that we will start working on the script for backend service. and it should be done by 18th of december.
After that we will polish the full work and will try to make the full project more organised.
